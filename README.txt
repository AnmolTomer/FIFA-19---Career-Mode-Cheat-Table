1. You need to execute lua script (<https://i.imgur.com/sFaGYbv.png>)
2. Table will automatically attach to the game process. GUI and "Database Tables" will be also automatically activated.
3. It may take a few second until GUI will appear after you run the cheat table
4. Because it's autoattaching, don't run cheat table too early. Probably, becasue of Denuvo, wait until you will be in main menu in game (here <https://i.imgur.com/Jnq60Hf.jpg>)
5. To save edits you made in GUI you need to press "apply changes" button".
